When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A project may require many contributers to work on it thus in order for other contributers
to work or to pull public suggestions remote repository is used.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be some changes made on local which don't want to made public and hence 
not updated on remote or changes in remote which you don't want on local. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

fork is used to clone someone's repository to yours directly, it still shows the
source of cloning.
clone is used to copy someone's repository to your local working directory , source
is not shown.
branch is used to diverge your code to two or more different directions which could be
merged later on ,if needed. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

If a person is going somewhere without internet access and is not ready to merge the
local and remote repository then we can have both copies seperately and work on both
seperately as well .

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Using Slack, bitbucket or some google online services but it would be harder

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

When you have two versions of a code, both of which you want to keep or you don't 
want to merge the codes for some reason or more than one user are working on the code 
then it can be done in different branches.
